# Data601-Smart-Research-Assistant-Chatbot-LijunZhou-

An intelligent academic literature exploration chatbot based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLM). It supports precise retrieval of relevant content from massive academic papers, provides concise and evidence-based answers to researchers and students through natural language interaction, and is equipped with a user-friendly web interface to simplify the academic literature exploration process.​
Project Overview
​
The core goal of this project is to build an AI chatbot integrated with the RAG framework, realizing the full-process automation from academic literature collection, preprocessing, embedding storage to intelligent Q&A. The project integrates large language models and vector databases, which can understand user natural language queries, retrieve relevant content from large-scale literature collections and generate context-aware responses. It also provides an intuitive web UI that supports conversation history viewing, literature source tracing and other functions. Currently, 16k papers have been downloaded and data exploration has been completed, and the development of data preprocessing, vector database construction and RAG pipeline is in progress.
